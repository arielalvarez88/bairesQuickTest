# bairesQuickTest

A very quick test done for BairesDev by Ariel Alvarez [arielalvarez88@gmail.com](mailto:arielalvarez88@gmail.com).

### This was done as fast as possible as asked, don't expect best practices!.

## To run:

Just run a web server in the root folder and go to index.html.

You can use the node package http-server to start a web server: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
